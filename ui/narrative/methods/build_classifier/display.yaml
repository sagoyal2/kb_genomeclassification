        ui-name : |
            Description
        short-hint : |
            Describe Purpose or Contents of Classifiers
        placeholder: |
            Enter Description
    n_neighbors :
        ui-name : |

            Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries.
    weights :
        ui-name : |
            Weights
        short-hint : |
            Weight function used in prediction. Possible values: ‘uniform’ : uniform weights. All points in each neighborhood are weighted equally. ‘distance’ : weight points by the inverse of their distance. in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a greater influence than neighbors which are further away. [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape containing the weights. 
    algorithm :
        ui-name : |
            Algorithm to Compute the Nearest Neighbors
        short-hint : |
            Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors: ‘ball_tree’ will use BallTree ‘kd_tree’ will use KDTree ‘brute’ will use a brute-force search. ‘auto’ will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm based on the values passed to fit method. Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of this parameter, using brute force.

        ui-name : |
            Leaf Size
        short-hint : |
            Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree. This can affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.

        ui-name : |
            Power Parameter
        short-hint : |
            Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.
    metric :
        ui-name : |
            Tree Metric
        short-hint : |
            The distance metric to use for the tree. The default metric is minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard Euclidean metric. See the documentation of the DistanceMetric class for a list of available metrics

        ui-name : |
            Addition Metrics
        short-hint : |
            Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

            Number of Jobs
        short-hint : |
            The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search. If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores. Doesn’t affect fit method.

        ui-name: |
            Prior Probability
        short-hint: |
            Prior probabilities of the classes. If specified the priors are not adjusted according to the data.
    penalty :
        ui-name : |
            Penalty algorithm
        short-hint : |
            Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’ and ‘lbfgs’ solvers support only l2 penalties.
    dual :
        ui-name : |
            Dual
        short-hint : |
            Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when n_samples > n_feature
    lr_tolerance :
        ui-name : |
            Tolerance
        short-hint : |
            Tolerance for stopping criteria.
    lr_C :
        ui-name : |
            C
        short-hint : |
            Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float. Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger regularization.
    fit_intercept :
        ui-name : |
            Fit Intercept
        short-hint : |
            Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be added to the decision function.
    intercept_scaling :
        ui-name : |
            Intercept Scaling
        short-hint : |
            Useful only when the solver ‘liblinear’ is used and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes [x, self.intercept_scaling], i.e. a “synthetic” feature with constant value equal to intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector. The intercept becomes intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight. Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization as all other features. To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.
    lr_class_weight :
        ui-name : |
            Class Weight
        short-hint : |
            Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y)). Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.    
    lr_random_state :
        ui-name : |
            Random State
        short-hint : |
            The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling the data. If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random. Used when solver == ‘sag’ or ‘liblinear’.   
    lr_solver :
        ui-name : |
            Solver algorithm
        short-hint : |
            For small datasets, ‘liblinear’ is a good choice, whereas ‘sag’ and ‘saga’ are faster for large ones. For multiclass problems, only ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ and ‘lbfgs’ handle multinomial loss; ‘liblinear’ is limited to one-versus-rest schemes. ‘newton-cg’, ‘lbfgs’ and ‘sag’ only handle L2 penalty, whereas ‘liblinear’ and ‘saga’ handle L1 penalty.
    lr_max_iter :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Iteration
        short-hint : |
            Useful only for the newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers. Maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.
    multi_class :
        ui-name : |
            Multi Class
        short-hint : |
            Multiclass option can be either ‘ovr’ or ‘multinomial’. If the option chosen is ‘ovr’, then a binary problem is fit for each label. Else the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit across the entire probability distribution. Does not work for liblinear solver.
    lr_verbose :
        ui-name : |
            Verbose
        short-hint : |
            For the liblinear and lbfgs solvers set verbose to 1 for verbosity.
    lr_warm_start :
        ui-name : |
            Warm Start
        short-hint : |
            When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution. Useless for liblinear solver.
    lr_n_jobs :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Jobs
        short-hint : |
            Number of CPU cores used when parallelizing over classes if multi_class=’ovr’”. This parameter is ignored when the ``solver``is set to ‘liblinear’ regardless of whether ‘multi_class’ is specified or not. If given a value of -1, all cores are used.
    criterion :
        ui-name : |
            Criterion
        short-hint : |
            The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain.

            Splitter
        short-hint : |
            The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported strategies are “best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split.

        ui-name : |
            Maximum Depth
        short-hint : |
            The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.
    min_samples_split :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Samples Split
        short-hint : |
            The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node: If int, then consider min_samples_split as the minimum number. If float, then min_samples_split is a percentage and ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each split.
    min_samples_leaf :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Samples Leaf
        short-hint : |
            The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node: If int, then consider min_samples_leaf as the minimum number. If float, then min_samples_leaf is a percentage and ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples) are the minimum number of samples for each node.
    min_weight_fraction_leaf :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Weight Fraction Leaf
        short-hint : |
            The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
    max_features :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Features
        short-hint : |
            For the liblinear and lbfgs solvers set verbose to 1 for verbosity.
    dt_random_state :

        short-hint : |
            If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by np.random.
    max_leaf_nodes :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Leaf Nodes
        short-hint : |
            Grow a tree with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    min_impurity_decrease :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Impurity Decrease
        short-hint : |
            A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value. The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following: N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity) where N is the total number of samples, N_t is the number of samples at the current node, N_t_L is the number of samples in the left child, and N_t_R is the number of samples in the right child. N, N_t, N_t_R and N_t_L all refer to the weighted sum, if sample_weight is passed.
    dt_class_weight :
        ui-name : |
            Class Weight
        short-hint : |
            Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y. Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}]. The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y)) For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied. Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.
    presort :
        ui-name : |
            Presort
        short-hint : |
            Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in fitting. For the default settings of a decision tree on large datasets, setting this to true may slow down the training process. When using either a smaller dataset or a restricted depth, this may speed up the training.

            Gamma
        short-hint : |
            Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’. If gamma is ‘auto’ then 1/n_features will be used instead.

        ui-name : |
            Probability
        short-hint : |
            Whether to enable probability estimates. This must be enabled prior to calling fit, and will slow down that method.
    shrinking :
        ui-name : |
            Shrinking
        short-hint : |
            Whether to use the shrinking heuristic.

        short-hint : |
            Set the parameter C of class i to class_weight[i]*C for SVC. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))
    svm_verbose :
        ui-name : |
            Verbose
        short-hint : |

    learning_rate :
        ui-name : |
            Learning Rate
        short-hint : |
            Learning rate schedule for weight updates. ‘constant’ is a constant learning rate given by ‘learning_rate_init’. ‘invscaling’ gradually decreases the learning rate learning_rate_ at each time step ‘t’ using an inverse scaling exponent of ‘power_t’. effective_learning_rate = learning_rate_init / pow(t, power_t) ‘adaptive’ keeps the learning rate constant to ‘learning_rate_init’ as long as training loss keeps decreasing.

            Maximum Iterations
        short-hint : |
           Maximum number of iterations. The solver iterates until convergence (determined by ‘tol’) or this number of iterations. For stochastic solvers (‘sgd’, ‘adam’), note that this determines the number of epochs (how many times each data point will be used), not the number of gradient steps.
    shuffle :
        ui-name : |
            Shuffle
        short-hint : |
            Whether to shuffle samples in each iteration. Only used when solver=’sgd’ or ‘adam’.

            Weights
        short-hint : |
            Sequence of weights (float or int) to weight the occurrences of predicted class labels (hard voting) or class probabilities before averaging (soft voting). Uses uniform weights if None.
